        <h2 class="headingSpace"> Step-by-Step for the teacher:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The teacher registers attendance using the paper sheet</li>
            <li>The teacher scans the paper with a camera, mobile scanner, or printer scanner</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="headingSpace">How it works:</h3>
        <p> Pen&Paper will read names, attendance, date, class, teacher, and school.
            The information is simple and the file is small, which means it is very easy to send.
            Either it is sent via the internet or satellite phone, which is important for 3rd world countries.
            Then it's stored in a database that can be accessed and distributed as needed.
            The program will automatically send out a notice to schools and teachers when a student has low attendance.
